 In the initial phase we made a new organization for our group project in GitHub and constructed three separate repositories.
 1. For the Front-End.
 2. For the Back-End.
3. Circle CI
The group members were added to the organization.
In the beginning we started by building the Front-End.
All the members were tasked to learn Java script, HTML and CSS and how to use react.js beforehand.
 We made an home page as the main page , sign-up and log-in screen.
Tools and Technologies
In order to work in a synchronized we used GIT and GitHub.
We have created a work environment for project management we are all in.
 The following tools and technologies are what we used: 
1) HTML
2)JavaScript
3)Render
4)React.js
We utilized components and JSX extensions so that we can Work with a combination of HTML and JavaScript on the same files.
