# Building website
In the initial phase we made a new repository for our group project in GitHub and constructed three separate repositories.

For the Front-End.
For the Back-End.
Circle CI The group members were added to the organization. In the beginning we started by building the Front-End. 
All the members were tasked to learn Java script, HTML and CSS and how to use react.js beforehand. We made an home page as the main page , sign-up and log-in screen. Tools and Technologies In order to work in a synchronized we used GIT and GitHub. We have created a work environment for project management we are all in. The following tools and technologies are what we used:
HTML 2)JavaScript 3)Render 4)React.js and also more libraries:
1)react-router-DOM - this library includes functionality of presenting the corresponding page after pressing a button.
For example, pressing on 'Login' in the homepage will lead to a new page where the user can enetr its username and password.
2)axios library- which responsible for message transfer on HTTP protocol.
3)chai and mocha -  for conducting testing.
4)linter -  for keeping uniform style of our code.
 We utilized components and JSX extensions so that we can Work with a combination of HTML and JavaScript on the same files.
