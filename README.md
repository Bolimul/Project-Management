# Building website
In the initial phase we made a new repository for our group project in GitHub and constructed three separate folders:
For the Front-End.
For the Back-End.
And for the CICD process.
The group members were added to the repository. In the beginning we started by building the Back-End. 
All the members were tasked to learn Java script, HTML and CSS and how to use react.js beforehand.
We made a home page,sign-up and log-in screen.
 In order to work in a synchronized we used GIT and GitHub. We have created a work environment for project management we are all in. 
The following tools and technologies are what we used:
1)JavaScript 2)Render 3)React.js 4)CircleCi and also more libraries:
1)react-router-DOM - this library includes functionality of presenting the corresponding page after pressing a button.
For example, pressing on 'Login' in the homepage will lead to a new page where the user can enetr its username and password.
2)axios library- which responsible for message transfer on HTTP protocol.
3)chai and mocha -  for conducting testing.
4)linter -  for keeping uniform style of our code.
 We utilized components and JSX extensions so that we can Work with a combination of HTML and JavaScript on the same files.
 
 Pay attention that after you register to the website(by entering your full name, username and password) and press on the Login button, there will be no message of “Welcome,{username)” like in the Login page. 
If you would like, you can open developer tools on your browser, and there will be presented the username chosen.

In order to login to the website, use the password : abc234!
